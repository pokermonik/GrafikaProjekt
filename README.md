# GrafikaProjekt
This app is currectly in development and currently has 3 modes:
1) "Paint" - allows user to draw lines, rectangles, circles, resize them, move them (both by keyboard input and mouse dragging), save it and load it later.
2) "PPM & JPG file reader & modifier" - allows user to read P3, P6 ppm and JPG type files, move them, zoom-in and zoom-out, get actual R G B values of pixel, save file as JPG with chosen compression level.
   This mode also allows to manipulate image - addition, substraction, multiplication, division, turn into gray-scale format, change brigtness, median filter, mean filter, sharpening filter. Added binarization, check % of darkest pixels, iterative mean selection. Alongside the image, there is shown histogram which shows how many are there pixels of certain values.
4) "RGB-CMYK" - allows user to move sliders and insert via keyboard (R G B) or (C M Y K) values to create a color, when moving in one colorspace, the values in the other one are generated.
