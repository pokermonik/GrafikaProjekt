# GrafikaProjekt
This app is currectly in development and currently has 3 modes:
1) "Paint" - allows user to draw lines, rectangles, circles, resize them, move them (both by keyboard input and mouse dragging), save it and load it later.
2) "PPM file reader" - allows user to read P3, P6 ppm and JPG type files, move them, zoom-in and zoom-out, get actual R G B values of pixel, save file as JPG with choosable compression level.
3) "RGB-CMYK" - allows user to move sliders and insert via keyboard (R G B) or (C M Y K) to create a color, when moving in one colorspace, the values in other are generated.
